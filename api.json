  "ReleaseNote": "- Included AfxHookSource 1.111.0 (2022-06-26T00:19Z).\r\n\r\n## AfxHookSource 1.111.0 (2022-06-26T00:19Z)\r\n- Fixed multiple bugs in mirv_pgl.\r\n- Fixed a bug with game events cache for server_spawn (id 0) CS:GO event in mirv_pgl and afx_interop, that could cause state errors / freezes / exceptions in afx_interop or in mirv_pgl when useCache is 1 when the event would appear a second time and wrongly encoded as cached (id 0 can not be cached and will not be cached anymore due to a protocol design flaw on my end (id 0 indicates uncached transmission, so it can not be told part from real id 0, so that one is always uncached now)).\r\n\r\nThe changes to mirv_pgl and afx_interop should be backwards compatible and have no negative side effects, testing is advised nevertheless.\r\n\r\nPlease note that CS:GO has a crash bug in the current latest release, that can be triggered upon level changed, especially when changing levels quickly and doing a lot of console toggling / keyboard input with F11 upon level loading. This is not an HLAE bug, it happens without HLAE as well. "
