  "ReleaseNote": "**HLAE 2.111.0 (2021-03-13T13:03Z)**\r\n* Included AfxHookGoldSrc 2.11.0 (2021-03-13T13:03Z).\r\n* Included AfxHookSource 1.93.1 (2021-03-13T13:03Z).\r\n\r\n**AfxHookGoldSrc 2.11.2 (2021-03-13T13:03Z)**\r\n*  Added mirv_agr command for GoldSrc. Known problems: Some special effects on models (e.g. the distortion on the hologram or left-handed models) will not be accurate, because they can't be accurately represented in AGR version 5.  \r\n Tested with Blender Source Tools 3.1.0, afx-blender-scripts 1.12.1, Crowbar 0.71.  \r\n Please note when using games with hires models (e.g. Half-Life single player regardless of cl_himodels, Half-Life multiplayer with cl_himodels 1), you will need to make sure to extract the right models, otherwise you will get broken results! If hires models are used decompile lowres version (e.g. valve/models) first and on-top of that decompile hires models (e.g. valve_hd/models). \r\n\r\n**AfxHookSource 1.93.1 (2021-03-13T13:03Z)**\r\n* Minor cosmetic code structure changes related to AGR."
