  "ReleaseNote": "# HLAE 2.113.4 (2021-04-12T06:47Z)\r\n* Included AfxHookGoldSrc 2.11.6 (2021-04-12T06:47Z).\r\n\r\n# AfxHookGoldSrc 2.11.6 (2021-04-12T06:47Z)\r\n* Fix GoldSrc AGR gait sequence export regression.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the in-eye model of the CS 1.6 knife will be wrong, which is because the engine mirrors the model with cl_righthand 1 and the current AGR format can not express that (same problem you would have for other v_models with cl_righthand 0). \r\nThis probably also applies e.g. to the hologram in Half-Life hazard course training when it is distored."
