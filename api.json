  "ReleaseNote": "**HLAE 2.109.8 (2021-01-25T13:23Z)**\r\n* Included AfxHookGoldSrc 2.10.1 (2021-01-25T13:23Z).\r\n\r\n**AfxHookGoldSrc 2.10.1 (2021-01-25T13:23Z)**\r\n*  Fixed wrongly returning a function for server.dll GetBlendingInterface when there actually is none, which causes errors for live TAS captures with HLAE in Half-Life. Please note that we do not recommend to live capture with HLAE, HLAE is meant for demos only mostly. Thanks to quadkid from advancedfx Discord for reporting the issue. "
